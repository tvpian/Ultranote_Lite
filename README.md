# UltraNote Lite (FULL, No Service Worker)

This is the full local-first app (Today/Projects/Ideas/Vault/Review) **without** a service worker,
so it works when opened directly from disk via `file://`.

## Run
Unzip and open `index.html` in Chrome/Edge.
(Optional) Serve statically:
```
python -m http.server 5173
# or
npx serve -p 5173
```
